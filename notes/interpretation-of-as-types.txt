Two interpretations of types of the form T['a] as 'a
 - if interereted as proper recursive (a.k.a., infinite) type,
    it means ('a -> Bot) as 'a is too restrictive a type for self-app
    (it's specialized for applying self-app to itself, resulting in non-term and the Bot type as expected),
    but the original type ('a -> 'b) as 'a works fine.
    explanation:
      'b cannot be simplified away, because it appears in both pos and neg,
      since 'a itself does (through its own recursive occurrence!)
 - if interpreted as a type variable bounded with its body accordingly to its position,
    then ('a -> Bot) as 'a is STILL NOT an acceptable type for self-app
    For instance, let's see what happens when we pass it (lam x. 42) of type Top -> Int;
      we constrain ?a <: (Top -> Int) -> ?b for some fresh ?b, where ?a :> (?a -> Bot)
      this leads to  (?a -> Bot)  <:  (Top -> Int) -> ?b
      decomposed as  (Top -> Int) <: ?a  and  Bot <: ?b
      which leads to  Top -> Int  <:  Top -> Int
      So the constraints work out, but we end up with result type ?b where ?b :> Bot,
      which is obviously wrong! (we should have gotten an Int)
    And this also happens for the original type ('a -> 'b) as 'a,
      which is however valid under the other interpretation!
    Here, we may need to think harder about the phrase "bounded accordingly to its position"
    Again, the position of 'a really is both pos and neg, so we should really interpret the type as
      ?a :> ('a -> 'b) <: ('a -> 'b)
    Under this revised interpretation, things work out when applying it to (lam x. 42):
      we constrain ?a <: (Top -> Int) -> ?c for some fresh ?c, where ?a :> (?a -> ?b) <: (?a -> ?b)
      this leads to  ?a -> ?b  <:  (Top -> Int) -> ?c
      decomposed as  (Top -> Int) <: ?a  and  ?b <: Int
      which leads to  Top -> Int  <:  Top -> Int  and  Top -> Int  <:  ?a -> ?b
      decomposed as  ?a <: Top  and  Int <: ?b
      which leads to  Int <: Int
      So the constraints work out, and we do get the appropriate result type Int

Conclusion:
  Both interpretations of "T['a] as 'a" as infinite types and as type variables seem valid and equivalent.
  We can treat "T['a] as 'a" as representing a type variable ?a upper and lower-bounded by T[?a].
  In the particular case where it appears only positively (resp. neg.) in the original type AS WELL
  AS in T[?a] itself, then we can forget about the lower bound (resp. upper bound).

Note:
  The bounds of a recursive types that appear both positively and negatively have no reason to be the same;
  so our interpretation above is unlikely to capture the full generality of recursive type variables.
  I have changed the type expansion algorithm to only produce recursive type variables which occur only
  in positive or only in negative positions (the change was easy). Before that, the algorithm was probably
  wrong anyways, under our both-bounds interpretation.
  We'll no longer infer things like "('a -> 'b) as 'a", but rather "(('a -> 'b) -> 'b) as 'a",
  which is easier to co-occurrence-anlayse using the current indrastructure (otherwise, we'd have to keep
  track of the fact some recursive variables may appear both posly and negly as we do the analysis!)
