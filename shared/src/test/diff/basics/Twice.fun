let twice f x = f / f x
//│ twice: ('a -> 'b & 'a) -> 'a -> 'b

// Note: once we instantiate during constraint solving instead of on variable reference,
//  the following should get the more useful type: 'a -> (1, (1 'a,),)
// Note: but then the pretty-printed type of `twice` should not be simplified to ('a | 'b -> 'a) -> 'b -> 'a
//  because function types would effectively become non-mergeable without losing precsion...
