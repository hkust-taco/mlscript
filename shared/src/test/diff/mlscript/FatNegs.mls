class Lit: { n: int }
//│ Defined class Lit

// TODO should eventually print these differently or make them truly equivalent
//  by making #Lit <: Lit, i.e. making the tags include the fields implicitly.

// * Q: What happens if one writes ~Lit instead of ~#Lit?
def nc: ~Lit
def nt: ~#Lit
//│ nc: ~Lit
//│   = <missing implementation>
//│ nt: ~Lit
//│   = <missing implementation>

// * A: It's not equivalent.

// * Demonstrates that the negated tag is a subtype of the whole negated class:
nc = nt
//│ ~Lit
//│   <:  nc:
//│ ~Lit
//│   = <no result>
//│     nt is not implemented

// * Demonstrates that the negated tag is not a supertype of the whole negated class:
:e
nt = nc
//│ ~Lit
//│   <:  nt:
//│ ~Lit
//│ ╔══[ERROR] Type mismatch in def definition:

//│ ║  l.9: 	def nc: ~Lit
